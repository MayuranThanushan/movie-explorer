# Movie Explorer App

## Project Overview

Movie Explorer is a web application that allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and discover trending films. The app fetches real-time data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API and provides an intuitive user experience with a search bar, movie details, and theme toggling functionality.

The app also supports the ability to save favorite movies, search history, and local persistence of user preferences like theme and favorite movies.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can type movie names to find matching results.
- **Trending Movies**: A section that displays trending movies from the API.
- **Movie Details**: Clicking on any movie poster shows detailed information, including:
  - Overview
  - Genre
  - Cast
  - Rating
  - Trailer Link
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a better user experience.
- **Favorites**: Users can save their favorite movies, which are stored in `localStorage` for persistence.
- **Search History**: The last searched movie is stored in `localStorage`.
